# CE-UY-3013-Final-Project-BOD-Test

This program checks the results of a 5-day Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) test. The program will check to see if the final effluent is less than 25 mg/L to make sure the wastewater management facility is compliant with the EPA's Clean Water Act. The program also has a % removal BOD calculator. This program finds BOD Ultimate and  graphs the DO and BOD vs. time overlayed on the same graph.

Inputs:
*  For Task 1: Dissolved Oxygen (DO) concentrations at t = 0 days and at t = 5 days for primary and secondary effluent wastewater samples in mg/L
* For Task 2: Dissolved Oxygen (DO) and BOD data in mg/L for x number of days 

Outputs: 
* For Task 1
  * 5-day BOD results calculations 
  * Average results for primary and secondary results
  * Whether pr not the facility in question is in compliance with EPA Clean Water Act 
  * Percent removal of BOD

* For Task 2
  * Plot of DO and BOD vs Time 
  * Value of BOD_Ultimate
